        "- Interpreted languages are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, translating source code into machine code on the fly. They are generally more portable because the same source code can be run on any platform with the appropriate interpreter. However, they tend to be slower due to the overhead of runtime translation. Errors are detected at runtime, which means the program may run until it encounters an error. Examples include Python and JavaScript.\n",
        "- Compiled languages are translated into machine code by a compiler before execution, creating an executable file. This machine code is specific to the target platform, making compiled languages less portable. However, they tend to be faster because the machine code is executed directly by the hardware without the need for runtime translation. Errors are detected at compile-time, which means the program will not run until all errors are fixed. Examples include C and C++.\n",
